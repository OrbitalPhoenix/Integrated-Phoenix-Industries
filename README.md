Intergrated Program Plan mod is based on the 1970 NASA plan for a connected master plan for the build up of space infrastructure supported by Apollo heritage and the introduction of the Earth Orbital Shuttle (STS). Currently included in this mod is the Space Tug (STV). The next development update will focus on extending Space Tug operations into landing systems, Reusable Nuclear Shuttle, Space Base construction, and any other ideas and systems which relate.
